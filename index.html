                <h4>My Goal</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>I'm here in AltSchool Africa for a special purpose, my goal is to become a world class Software
                        Engineer.</p>
                    <p>For some couple of years ago, I realized how vastly and broadly Technology is changing the
                        universe.
                        So, I asked myself, how do I become part of this amazing career?</p>
                    <p>Then, I came to realize that for me to become part of this ruling career, I will need a good
                        foundation and that's why I choosed AltSchool Africa.</p>

                <h4>Who I'm</h4>
                <p>I'm a Web developer with an extensive experience for over 3 years. Have been working on projects,
                    building websites and web apps for small and at times large scale enterprises and also freelancing.
                </p>
                <p>Found out that for me to be that Tech person I always dream about,I need to go beyond just the Web.
                </p>
                <p>Also, I need a recognised and standard platform and that's why I'm at AltSchool Africa as a Software
                    Engineer.</p>
